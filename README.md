Hi, Iâ€™m RubÃ©n MaÃ­llo ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of Computer Engineering and Game Development at Tecnocampus UPF. Passionate about game development, software architecture, and microservices, with experience in Unity, Spring Boot, Jenkins, RabbitMQ, and Kafka.
I enjoy creating practical projects that combine good design, clean code, and innovative solutions, and I am always learning new technologies and methodologies to grow as a developer.
